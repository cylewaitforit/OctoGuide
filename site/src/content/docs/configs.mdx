import RulesTable from "../../components/RulesTable.astro";

OctoGuide provides two starting preset "configs", or lists of rules:

- **recommended** _(default)_: Rules that apply to almost every open source GitHub repository
- **strict**: Everything in _recommended_, plus enforcing semantic pull request conventions
- **none**: No rules applied, useful for when you want to apply only a few user set rules

See [Configuration > `config`](./get-started#configuration) for how to specify a config in your GitHub Actions workflow.
