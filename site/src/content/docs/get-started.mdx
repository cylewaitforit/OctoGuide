OctoGuide checks that contributor activity on your GitHub repository aligns with common expectations of smoothly-running projects.
It will automatically post friendly comments when contributors take actions you don't want them to.

## Installation

Once added as a GitHub Actions workflow, OctoGuide will automatically post comments advising users if their contribution activity violates any common best practices.
OctoGuide can scan comment, discussion, issue, and pull request events.

Add the following `.github/workflows/octoguide.yml` file to get started:

<Code
	code={getStartedBase}
	lang="yml"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

Once you've created that `.yml` file, congrats!
OctoGuide should be enabled on your repository.

To test it out, try adding a comment with just the text _"+1"_ on an existing issue.
OctoGuide should post a response within 10-15 seconds.

## Configuration

### `config`

OctoGuide by default enables a _recommended_ set of rules.
You can extend it to use a _strict_ superset by adding `config: strict` to the action's `with`:

<Code
	code={getStartedStrict}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

The _strict_ config includes all rules from _recommended_ plus more rules that enforce more opinionated practices.

See [Preset Configs](./configs) for more information on preset configs and their rules.

### `github-token`

OctoGuide requires a `github-token` for the action to be able to post comments.
GitHub's provided `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` allows it to post as the general `github-actions[bot]`.

If you'd like the action to post as a different user, you can provide a token with permissions to comment on your repository.
For public repositories that's the following permissions:

- `repo` > `public_repo`
- `read:discussion`

### `comment-footer`

You can customize the footer message that OctoGuide adds to its comments by providing a `comment-footer` input as a string.

**Example:**

<Code
	code={getStartedFooter}
	meta="lang=yml"
	lang="diff"
	title=".github/workflows/octoguide.yml"
/>

If no custom footer is provided, OctoGuide uses its default message.
