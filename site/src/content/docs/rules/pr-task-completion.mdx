Repositories often provide a set of tasks that pull request authors are expected to complete.
Those tasks should be marked as completed with a `[x]` in the pull request description.

Repositories often include a template file for pull requests, commonly `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
Contributors are expected to fill out that template file for their pull request descriptions.
Template files with `- [ ]` task lists are generally expected to `[x]` fill out every item in the list to confirm they've taken that step.

```md
- [x] Added tests
```

## Optional Task Lists

GitHub-flavored Markdown does not provide a way to indicate which task list items are optional or required.
This rule cannot statically determine which tasks must have a `[x]`.

If you don't believe a task needs to be completed, consider marking the task's text with `~~` strikethrough and explaining why.
For example, the following markdown:

```md
- [x] ~~Added tests~~ Docs-only change
```

...is rendered as:

- [x] ~~Added tests~~ Docs-only change
