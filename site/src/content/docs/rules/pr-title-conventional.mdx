A repository using this rule enforces that pull request titles follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format.
Doing so helps to ensure that the purpose of a pull request is clear and consistent for humans and machines.

Specifically, keeping to the conventional commit format helps:

- Humans: it becomes easier to categorize and understand pull request purposes quickly
- Machines: automated tooling can parse those titles into semver-based releases

If a repository has this rule enabled, it's likely aiming for either or both of those benefits.

## Allowed Titles

This rule asks that titles be in either format:

```plaintext
type: body
type(scope): body
```

- `type`: the conventional commit type, such as `docs` or `fix`
- `scope`: an optional sub-area, commonly a package name if a monorepo
- `body`: a lower-case description

Example acceptable titles include:

```plaintext
docs: mention 'rick' feature in README.md
feat: add optional new 'roll' option to API
fix(parser): don't throw error on consecutive semicolons
```

## Examples

[Pull request with a non-semantic title](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuideExamples/pull/3#issuecomment-2839276016):

<OctoGuideGitHubComment rule="pr-title-conventional">
	The PR title is missing a conventional commit type, such as <em>"docs: "</em>{" "}
	or <em>"feat: "</em>. This repository asks that pull request titles start with
	a type in the{" "}
	<a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org">Conventional Commits</a> format.
	Doing so helps make the purpose of each pull request clear for humans and
	machines. To resolve this report, add a conventional commit type in front of
	the title, like <em>"feat: Update README.md"</em>.
