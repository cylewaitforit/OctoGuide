A repository using this rule keeps to GitHub issues for discussing potential changes.
Most or all changes should be marked as approved in an issue before a pull request is sent to resolve them.

## Linking an Issue

To link a pull request to an issue:

1. Make sure there's an issue describing what you want to happen
2. Add text in the format `closes #...` or `fixes #...` in your PR, such as `fixes #123`

## Why Require Issues?

Requiring all contributor pull requests address an open issue adds process to a repository.
Not all repositories prefer this.
Some prefer to instead make it as straightforward as possible to send a pull request, and then only move conversations to issues as needed.

The advantages of starting with issues are:

- Consolidation: most or all conversations are moved to a single place, the issue tracker
- Discoverability: it's much easier to search within just the issue tracker, rather than also looking through ad hoc pull request discussions
- Tracking: issues often use different their own sets of labels tailored to their conversations

Most importantly, if you're contributing to a repository with a contribution guide, please read and respect that contribution guide.

## Examples

[PR not linked to an existing issue](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuideExamples/pull/6#issuecomment-2839460254):

<OctoGuideGitHubComment rule="pr-linked-issue">
This pull request is not linked as closing any issues.
This repository keeps to GitHub issues for discussing potential changes.
Most or all changes should be marked as approved in an issue before a pull request is sent to resolve them.
To resolve this report:

<ol>
	<li>
		If this is a straightforward documentation change that doesn't need an
		issue, you can ignore this report
	</li>
	<li>
		If there is a backing issue, add a 'fixes #...' link to the pull request
		body
	</li>
	<li>Otherwise, file an issue explaining what you'd like to happen</li>
</ol>
